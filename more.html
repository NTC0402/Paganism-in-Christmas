                  <h1 id="1">KISSING UNDER A MISTLETOE</h1>
                  <span>Ever wondered about the correlation between mistletoe and kissing? Well, funnily enough, the tradition goes all the way back to the pagans. Everyone from the Romans and Celts to the Druids and the Norse had a thing about mistletoe. It was considered to be a highly sacred plant, involved in several pagan rituals.</span>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <span>In the Roman world, mistletoe honoured the god Saturn. To keep him happy, they would perform fertility rituals underneath sprigs of mistletoe – yes, that’s exactly what it sounds like! We’ve certainly toned it down as far as mistletoes are considered, and left it with just a simple kiss – probably a good idea since family is always around.</span>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <span>In the world of the <a href="druid.html">Druids</a>, mistletoe symbolised peace and joy. In times of war, if enemies were to meet underneath woodland mistletoe then they would drop their weapons and form a truce until the next day. In a way, kissing is a form of truce…</span>
                  <h1 id="2">SANTA’S IMAGE & CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS</h1>
                  <span>Our current modern day image of Santa Claus, clad in red fur with a big white beard, was largely developed by Coca-Cola in the 1930s. But the idea of an old man giving gifts to children dates much earlier than that, back to the time of the pagans.</span>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <span>Father Christmas, otherwise known as St. Nicholas, was a patron saint of children, the poor, and prostitutes. Living around 4th century AD, St. Nicholas was a generous bishop who was known for giving gifts to the poor, sporting a big beard and a long cloak much like the Santa we know and love.</span>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <span>But even before St. Nicholas, there was another bearded old man called <a href="odin.html">Odin</a>. This diety was worshipped by early Germanic pagan tribes, traditionally portrayed as an old man with a long, white beard with an 8-legged horse called <a href="spiderhorse.html">Sleipnir</a> who he would ride through the skies (just like Santa’s reindeer). During the winter, kids would fill their booties with carrots and straw and leave them by the chimney for Sleipnir to feed on. Odin would fly by and reward the children with little presents in their booties, much like we do with Christmas stockings today.</span>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <span>The Santa Claus we all imagine in our heads today is a mish-mash of the generous St. Nicholas, the god Odin and Sleipnir, and Coca-Cola’s iconic red-dressed character.</span>
